# IPparallel_tools
Tools for use with IPython.parallel.

Tools provided - 
Cluster:
  A class for the creation and use of temporary ssh-based clusters
  
starmap:
  nearly analagous to itertools.starmap for asychronous parallel mapping of a function to the elements of an iterable.  (The input iterable could, in theory, be infinite)
